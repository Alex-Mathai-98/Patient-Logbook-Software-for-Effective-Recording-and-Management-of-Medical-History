<!-- The extend statement helps to use the base template that is provided by the base.hmtl file. All the new code then goes into the block content tag that is provided in the base.html file-->

<!-- blog.views.post_detail is a path to a post_detail view we want to create. Please note: blog is the name of our application (the directory blog), views is from the name of the views.py file and the last bit – post_detail – is the name of the view.

And how about pk=post.pk? pk is short for primary key, which is a unique name for each record in a database. Because we didn't specify a primary key in our Post model, Django creates one for us (by default, a number that increases by one for each record, i.e. 1, 2, 3) and adds it as a field named pk to each of our posts. We access the primary key by writing post.pk, the same way we access other fields (title, author, etc.) in our Post object! -->

{% extends 'blog/base.html' %}

{% block content %}
    {% for post in posts %}
        <div class="post">
            <h1><a href="{% url 'post_detail' pk=post.pk %}">{{ post.title }}</a></h1>
            <div class="date">
                <p>Published: {{ post.published_date }}</p>
            </div>
            <p>{{ post.text|linebreaksbr }}</p>
        </div>
    {% endfor %}
