# Patient-Logbook-Software
Patient Logbook Software with integrated Frontend and Backend

--> This was an attempt at making an integrated interface that would be used to link patient data and surgery logbooks to existing 
medical records.

--> The whole backend was created with the python-django framework. Some of the back-end development work included the creation of
highly complex data fields. Advanced interlinking of one-one, one-many and many-many relations among objects was extensively used
and in some cases intermediary fields were used as a additional layer of abstraction of data. My work also included form validation,
creation and its automatic population with the database.

--> In the frontend integration, there was extensive use of the bootstrap content delivery network. Also a great deal of time
went into writing some javascript, AJAX for automated refreshal of data without page reloading and lots of HTML and CSS to make the
site pretty.
